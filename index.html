Whilst it's important for a product to grow in-order to meet the needs of users, it's easy for code to become unclean and lose any sense of architecture. This legacy code makes it difficult for us to maintain our product and build new features without the fear of breaking the app.</p> <p>But there is light! At Buffer we've just started to re-architect and refactor our application for Android using a clean architecture approach. Re-crafting our application feature by feature with the help of RxJava, Dagger and tests in the form of jUnit and Espresso has begun to result in a more stable, better architected and maintainable codebase. Together with our new continuous Integration flow this all helps in providing a better Buffer experience on Android.</p> <p>In this talk we will explore the journey we took through refactoring from legacy code to a clean architecture. Starting with heart of our app, the Composer, we'll share our learnings and findings discovered on our journey and the benefits from doing so.</p> <p><b>Speakers: Joe Birch &amp; Marcus Wermuth </b></p> <p>Hey there we are Joe and Marcus, we are the Android Dev Team at Buffer!</p> <p>Both Joe and me (Marcus) are super passionate about Android and the whole architecture behind it. We love to discuss clean architecture, testing principles and CI Integrations. Joe is an avid writer sharing all of his experiences in the Android world, also currently working on a Firebase Book I myself love to think about Design and User Interfaces, while also thinking about the product development.</p> <p><b>Follow them: </b>@hitherejoe &amp; @mwermuth</p> <p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p><b>*Open Mic Session </b></p> <p>We open the floor to you, the London Android community.
